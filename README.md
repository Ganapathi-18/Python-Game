# Python-Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic "Slither" game using the Python programming language and the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to control a snake on the screen, guiding it to eat apples, and as it eats more apples, the snake grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the screen boundaries or its own body.
